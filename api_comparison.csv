Let's think of Earth for just a moment as a greenhouse. Every second a huge amount of energy smashes into our greenhouse. Our atmosphere. The glass roof and walls reflects some of that energy, but most of it passes right through and heats everything up. Much of that heat used to escape back into space, keeping us at a stable, warm temperature. But then something changed. Humans began to spew enough carbon dioxide to fill billions of greenhouses each day. What does all that greenhouse gas do? It makes the glass of our greenhouse thicker. Thicker glass means heat escapes into space much more slowly on. Don't forget. Energy from the sun is still streaming in Justus quickly as before. The result is a planet with temperatures too hot for our liking and eventually living."
